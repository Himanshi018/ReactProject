Store is single source of tools
store needs to know wherethe Reducers are 

Features: Slice
for making slice there are three major requirements:
1. name 
2. initialState
3. reducers list

first we make initialState
then give names and create reducersList

here in reducers we have access of two things
1. State 2.Action
#in state we get updated value in the store
#in action we get action.payload
then we have the access of state so we push the elements of todo
But in context api we needed to use spread function to spread the elements of array then add a new element

but here the state is preserved so we can directly push into the state

Now we need to export every reducer as we don't know which component will use which reducer

and also export the main source of reducers

then we have to take value or send value
The reducer is sent through dispatch (useDispatch)
and the value is taken using Selector (useSelector)
