Why context api is needed ?
It is needed as when we want any component inside any other component
so we don't need to take it on every component can be said parent component(not necessarily)
but directly by making the global variable of that component
Then we will use context api by useContext()


step 1: Store context in variable after create context
and export in output

We need to make a provider with every context
context is like a global variable

how to use it?
we will make a wrapper of context
Then it will become provider
Then every component will get the access to the global variable
directly tly get access to all the states from user context
